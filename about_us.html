		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>Laura and I were born into a family where music was extremely prevalent all around us. Our father played the saxophone and guitar, and our mother was a very talented pianist. Both of them volunteered their talents into the Church band.<br> Because of this musical influence coming from all around us, Laura and I embarked on our musical journey from a very young age. Our mother always loved stringed instruments, and got us to play as soon as we could hold a bow! My sister was 7 when she started the double bass, and I began the cello when I was just 4 years old (I was too small to hold a double bass!) We also both studied Musicianship up to grade 5.<br> <br>
However, in time, our string training felt like a chore, rather then a fun output for creativity. These feelings turned us to learning guitar from our father, for fun, instead of for AMEB grading. I remember it felt like such a different experience to play the songs I wanted to play, instead of a List A, B, C and D and extra lists chosen by my teacher! This feeling was one of the driving reasons that pushed us to create this website: to share with others a valuable skill set and fun, creative output for emotions and and enjoyable way to pass the time and improve a wide range of skills.<br>
<br>
I hope that you enjoy learning the basics of guitar with us as much as we did when we strummed our first G major chord! I hope that this small portion of our musical journey shared with helps you to start, or progress in yours. Keep strumming! :)</p>
